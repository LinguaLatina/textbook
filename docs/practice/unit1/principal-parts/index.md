## Principal parts

1. How many principal parts does a regular Latin verb have?
2.  Which principal parts are finite verb forms? What person and number is used for these principal parts?
3. The verb *interficiō* "to kill" is actually a compound of the verb *faciō*.  (Compare the way English can create phrasal verbs: "do away with" someone does not mean the same thing as "do" something!)  Compare the principal parts of *faciō* and *interficiō*. Which parts are identical to prefixing *inter-* to a form of *facio*? What changes in the other forms?


Memorize the principal parts of the verbs in the vocabulary list for unit 1, then answer the following questions.

- name two verbs belonging to the fourth conjugation. How regular are their principal parts?
- compare the principal parts of the verbs capiō "to seize" and facio "to do, make".  How are the changes in their principal parts similar?
