# About this textbook

The current on-line version of this textbook is simultaneously being drafted and used in Latin 101 at the College of the Holy Cross in 2022-2023.

  

We expect to complete the first half of the textbook through chapter 5, "Subordination," in one college semester.  Chapters are not intended to take equal amounts of time.  Chapter 3, "Inflection of verbs, nouns, pronouns,and adjectives" requires approximately 6 weeks, and Chapter 5, "Subordination," about a month; the intervening Chapter 4, "Richer sentences," covers much less new material, and provides an opportunity to apply and reinforce the fundamental material from Chapter 3.  At Holy Cross, this chapter falls around the time of our fall break, so is also a useful moment to regroup and refresh material covered in the first half of the semester.

The draft of this material that was used in 2021-2022 is included at [https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/2021-2022/).
