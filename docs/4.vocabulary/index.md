# Vocabulary lists

The lists linked below give dictionary forms and very brief definitions for ca. 250 of the most frequently occuring words in Hyginus' *Fabulae*. You can find very full entries with examples of usage in the searchable online version of [Lewis and Short's *Latin Dictionary*](http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html) (from Furman University).


> These 250 terms represent roughly 2/3 of all the words in Hyginus' text!

The vocabulary lists use `j` and `v` for consonantal sounds, `i` and `u` for vocalic sounds.  This is the same spelling convention that you will find in  the Lewis-Short Dictionary.  Remember that we often use texts with different spelling conventions (e.g., *i* for both consonantal and vocalic sounds), so that to find a vocbulary entry for a form like `iussit` (third singular perfect active indicative), you would look under `j` to find `jubeo, jubÄ“re, jussi, jussus`.
