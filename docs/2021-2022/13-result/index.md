# Expressions of Result

In English, an expression of result tells us the result of the action of the main verb. Below are some basic examples and variations of expressions of result (the expression of result is bolded):

- She was **so** smart **that even her teachers were awed by her intelligence**.
- He worked **so** hard **that he never slept.**
- She helped them with their homework **in such a way that they got a good grade in the course**.

Notice that the first two examples include the signal adverb **"so"**. Words like "so", "so much", "such", and "such great" often indicate the presence of a result clause in a sentence.

# Result Clauses

The most common way to express result in Latin is through a **result clause**. Result clauses are dependent clauses (i.e., they generally follow an main clause) that have three key features:

- A subordinating conjunction (**ut** for a positive result clause, but **ut nōn** for a negative result clause
  - Note that this differs from a negative purpose clause, which is introduced with **nē**.
- A subject (stated or implied)
- A verb in the **present** or **imperfect subjunctive**, depending on the [**sequence of tenses**](../08-temporal-clauses/#subjunctive-verbs-and-the-sequence-of-tenses/)

In addition to these three key features, a result clause will be sometimes be preceded by a main clause that features an adjective or adverb of degree such as *tam* ("so"); *tantus, -a, -um* ("such great, so much"); *tālis, -e* ("such"); *ita* ("so"); *sīc* ("thus"); or *adeō* ("to such an extent").

How do we translate a sentence containing a result clause? Take the following example:

- Tantā irā conclamavērunt ut nēmo responderet.

First, we break the sentence into dependent (bolded) and independent (italicized) clauses. In the case of a sentence containing a result clause, we can recognize the dependent clause rather easily as it begins with **ut** or **ut nōn**.

- *Tantā irā conclamavērunt* **ut nēmo respondēret**.

We then translate the independent clause (notice the use of **tantā** in the independent clause):

- They shouted with **such great** anger **ut nēmo responderet**.

After that, we translate the result clause starting with the conjunction: **ut** plus the verb becomes "that [subject] *verb[ed]*", while **ut nōn** plus the verb becomes "that [subject] did/does/will not [verb]". The tense of the verb in the result clause translation depends on whether you're in primary or secondary sequence. Take a look at the example from above:

- *Tantā irā conclamavērunt* **ut nēmo responderet**.
- They shouted with such great anger that no one responded.

In primary sequence, the sentence and translation might look something like this:

- *Tantā irā conclamant* **ut nēmō respondeat**. They are shouting with such anger that no one responds.

Take a look at some more examples of result clauses:

- *verentur adeō ut dormīre nōn possint.* They are afraid **to such an extent that they are not able to sleep.**
- *mīles tantam virtūtem habuit ut sōlus profiscerētur.* The soldier had **such great** courage **that he set out alone**.
- *regīna ita ācris erat ut nēmō eam pugnāre vellet.* The queen was **so** fierce **that no one wanted to fight her**.
