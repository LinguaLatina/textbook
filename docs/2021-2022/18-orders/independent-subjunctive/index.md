# Negative Prohibition

In the last unit on [negating imperatives](../imperative/#negative-imperatives/), we learned that we can use the imperative of **nōlō, nōlle, nōluī** (**nōli!** and **nōlite!** for singular and plural respectively) with a complementary infinitive to issue a command that someone *not* do something.

Another way to express a negative command in the 2nd or 3rd person is to use a **perfect subjunctive** in an independent clause introduced by **nē**. We call this construction **negative prohibition**.

- **nē timuerīs!** Don't be afraid!
- **nē id aspexerītis!** Don't look at it!

The [negative imperative](../imperative/#negative-imperatives/), however, is more common.

## Jussive Subjunctive

Like negative prohibition, the **jussive subjunctive** is an **independent** use of the subjunctive (meaning it stands on its own in a clause and does not rely on a main clause) that expresses a command in the **third person**. Note the difference between the jussive subjunctive and the imperative: the latter gives an order directly to a listener (second person), while the jussive subjunctive gives an order to a *third* person entity (a "he," "she," "it," or "they").

Take a look at the following examples:

- **bona verba dīcat.** Let him say good words.
- **hanc linguam discant.** Let them learn this language.
- **ā marī veniat.** Let her come from the sea.

Jussives are negated with **nē**:

- **nē nōs videant.** Let them not see us.
- **nē id faciat.** Let him not do it.

## Hortatory Subjunctive

Like negative prohibition and the jussive subjunctive, the **hortatory subjunctive** is an **independent** use of the subjunctive that expresses a command in the **first** person. Note the difference between the hortatory subjunctive and the jussive: the latter gives an order to a **third** person entity, while the hortatory subjunctive gives an order to a **first** person entity, often in the plural ("we" or "us"). For this reason, a nickname for the hortatory subjunctive is the "salad subjunctive" ("let us leave" = "lettuce leave").

- **eāmus et ludum aspiciāmus.** Let us go and watch the game.
- **cēnam cum familiā nostrā habeāmus.** Let us have dinner with our family.
- **pulchrum carmen eōrum audiāmus.** Let us listen to their beautiful song.

Like the jussive, the hortatory is negated with **nē**:

- **nē canāmus.** Let us not sing.
- **nē eōs interficiāmus.** Let us not kill them.
