# Imperative Mood

The imperative is the third of three **moods** in Latin. We've had extensive practice with the primary two: the **indicative mood**, which is used for factual situations; and the **subjunctive mood**, which is used for non-factual situations (doubt, possibility, wish, etc.).

This third mood, the **imperative mood**, exists mostly in the 2nd person and issues an order from the speaker to the addressee. For example:

- **audī!** Listen! (to a singular addressee) (2nd sg. pres. imperative act.)
- **audīte!** Listen! (to a group of people) (2nd pl. pres. imperative act.)

The verbal action is a command being issued to the listener. The singular imperative commands a single addressee to do something; the plural imperative commands a group of addressees to do something.

To form the imperative of **1st, 2nd, and 4th conjugation verbs**:
- in the singular, simply chop the -re off the infinitive.
  - amāre - **amā!** "Love!"
  - sedēre - **sedē!** "Sit!"
  - audīre - **audī!** "Listen!"
- in the plural, add **-te** to the singular imperative form.
  - **amāte!** "Love!" (to a plural group)
  - **sedēte!** "Sit!"
  - **audīte!** "Listen!"

To form the imperative of **3rd and 3rd -iō conjugation verbs**:
- in the singular, chop the -re off the infinitive, as in the other conjugations:
  - regere - **rege!** "Rule!"
  - capere - **cape!** "Take!"
- but in the plural, change the stem vowel to **-i-** before adding the **-te**:
  - **regite!** "Rule!" (to a plural group)
  - **capite!** "Take!"

Take a look at the following examples.

- **epistulam scrībe!** Write the letter!
- **verba eius audīte!** Listen to his words!
- **dā mihi basia mille!** Give a thousand kisses to me! (Catullus 5.7)

## Irregular Imperatives

There are four verbs that have irregularly-formed singular imperatives:
- dīcere - **dīc!** "Speak!"
- dūcere - **dūc!** "Lead!"
- facere - **fac!** "Do! / Make!"
- ferre - **fer!** "Bring!"

Their plurals follow normal third and third -iō conjugation patterns, except for **ferre**:
- dīcere - **dīcite!** "Speak!"
- dūcere - **dūcite!** "Lead!"
- facere - **facite!** "Do! / Make!"
- ferre - **ferte!** "Bring!"

The imperative of the verb **eō, īre, iī/īvī, ītus** ("to go") is formed as follows:
- singular: **ī!** "Go!"
- plural: **īte!** "Go!"

## Negative Imperatives

To negate an imperative, we will not use the expected **nōn** or **nē**, but rather, we will use a specific syntactic construction. To form a negative imperative, we use the imperative forms of **nōlō, nōlle, nōluī** with a **complementary infinitive**. The singular imperative of **nōlō** is **nōlī**; the plural imperative of **nōlō** is **nōlīte**.

- **nōlī timēre!** Don't be afraid!
- **nōlīte id aspicere.** Don't look at it!
