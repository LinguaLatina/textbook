# Proviso Clauses

If the action of the independent clause happens only under the particular circumstances described by the dependent clause, the dependent clause is referred to a **proviso clause**. There are a number of words that can introduce clauses of proviso (*dum*, *dummodo*, *modo*), which usually are translated as "if only", "only", "so/as long as", or "provided that." The clause of proviso always features a subjunctive verb in either the present or imperfect subjunctive, depending on the [**sequence of tenses**](../08-temporal-clauses/#subjunctive-verbs-and-the-sequence-of-tenses/). Clauses of proviso are negated by adding *nē* into the clause.

Below are some examples of proviso clauses (subjunctive verbs in the proviso clauses are bolded):

- *Dum* ***metuant***, *oderint*. (So long as they are scared, let them be hateful)

- *Magnō timore mē liberabis, dummodo inter me atque te murus* ***intersit***. (You will free me from great fear, provided that there is a wall between me and you).

- *Erimus felices, modo nē* ***discedas***. (We will be happy, provided that you do not leave.)
