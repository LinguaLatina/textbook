# Superlative Degree

The superlative degree of an adjective indicates that the noun described has the **most** of the adjectival quality of anyone that possesses that quality. So, we can usually translate it as the "-est" or "most" form of the adjective. Occasionally, we can translate the superlative as "very [adjective]."

To form the superlative degree of an adjective, add the endings **-issimus, -issima, -issimum** to the stem and decline it as a regular 2-1-2 adjective:

- longus, -a, -um, "long" > longior, longius, "longer" > **longissimus, -a, -um**, "longest"
- sapiēns, sapientis, "wise" > sapientior, sapientius, "wiser" > **sapientissimus, -a, -um**, "wisest"
- fortis, -e, "brave, strong" > fortior, fortius, "braver, stronger" > **fortissimus, -a, -um**, "bravest, strongest"

Again, like any other adjective, a superlative adjective must agree with its noun in gender, case, and number:
- **hostēs ā fortissimīs mīlitibus victī sunt.** The enemies were defeated by the bravest soldiers.
- **dīxit illās sapientissimās esse.** He said that those women were the wisest.
- **iter longissimum erat.** The journey was very long.

## Superlative with *quam*

We can also use **quam** with a superlative to indicate "as [adjective] as possible":

- **hic vir** ***quam sapientissimus*** **est**. This man is *as wise as possible*.
- **dīxit hostem** ***quam ferocissimum*** **esse**. He said that the enemy was *as fierce as possible*.
