# Subjunctive Conditions

Two conditions that use the subjunctive indicate actions that would have happened upon the enactment of some condition; however, that condition was not met, so the entire condition is just a thought experiment that is contrary to what factually happened or is happening. A third condition that uses the subjunctive indicates an action that may occur in the future contingent upon the completion of a condition, but it's uncertain whether it will happen.

## Past Contrary-to-Fact

A **past contrary-to-fact** (or **past contrafactual**) condition indicates what **would have** happened **if** something **had** happened. Both clauses will use the **pluperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive straightforwardly: "had [verb]ed".

The apodosis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive with the auxiliaries "would have [verb]ed."

- *sī id fēcisset, sapiēns fuisset.* If he had done it, he would have been wise.

Note that the subjunctive mood indicates the irreality of this condition. If he had done it, he would have been wise: but he didn't do it, and therefore he wasn't. The condition is **contrary to fact** because it didn't happen.

## Present Contrary-to-Fact

A **present contrary-to-fact** (or **present contrafactual**) condition indicates what **would** happen **if** something **were** happening. Both clauses will use the **imperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary "were [verb]ing."

The apodosis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary "would [verb]."

- *sī id faceret, sapiēns esset.* If he were doing it, he would be wise.

The same contrary-to-fact-ness applies to this condition, but in present time. If he *were* doing it, he would be wise -- but he isn't doing it, and so he's not.

## Future Less Vivid

The **future less vivid** condition indicates an action that **would** happen in the future, if another action **should** happen first. Both clauses will use the **present subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary "should [verb]."

The apodosis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary "would [verb]."

- *sī id faciat, sapiēns sit.* If he should do it, he would be wise.

Note that the translation of the apodosis is the same as the apodosis of a present contrary-to-fact; the difference lies in the time when the action of the protasis would be completed: in the present for a present contrary-to-fact; in the future for a future less vivid.

Rarely, you may see a perfect subjunctive instead of a present subjunctive in the protasis:

- sī id fēcerit, sapiēns sit. If he should do it, he would be wise.

Be careful not to mix up the **future less vivid**, a subjunctive condition that uses the present subjunctive, with the **future more vivid**, an indicative condition that uses the future or future perfect indicative. The **future** ***more*** **vivid** is "more vivid" because of the indicative mood, indicating that it's likely to happen; the **future** ***less*** **vivid** is "less vivid" because the subjunctive mood introduces a note of doubt.
