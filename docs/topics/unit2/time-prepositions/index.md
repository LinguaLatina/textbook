## Place and time expressions

# Expressions of Place

Latin uses the accusative and ablative case, frequently with prepositions, to express ideas related to space and place.

Below are the different expressions of place used in Latin:

1) **Accusative of place to which** or **motion toward** (*ad*, *trāns*, or *in* + accusative):
- Currēbat **ad pātrem**. ("She was running towards her father.")
- Vēnit **in urbem**. ("He came into the city.")

The accusative of **place to which** or **motion toward** is almost always used with a verb that indicates physical motion; for example, *venīre*, "to come" or *currere*, "to run."

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the accusative without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind.

2) **Ablative of place where** (*in* or *prō* + ablative):
* Hercules **in rēgnō** Theseī vīxit. ("Hercules lived **in the kingdom** of Theseus.")
* Mīlitēs **prō castris** pugnābant. ("The soldiers were fighting **in front of the camps**.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the **locative case** without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind.

3) **Ablative of place from which** or **motion from** (*ā/ab* or *ē/ex* + ablative):
* Puella **ab urbe** fugiēbat. ("The girl was fleeing **from the city**.")
* Nāvis **ex portō** nāvigāvit. ("The ship sailed **out of the port**.")

The ablative of **place from which** or **motion from** is almost always used with a verb that indicates physical motion; for example, *fugere*, "to flee" or *navigāre*, "to sail."

4) **Accusative of extent of space** (no preposition):
* Puer **quīnque pedes** altus est. ("The boy is **five feet** tall.")

# Expressions of Time

The accusative and ablative cases (without prepositions) can also be used to express ideas related to time. You can often spot these uses if the accusative or ablative in question is a word that relates to time: for example,

- *annus, ī*, m., "year"
- *mensis, -is*, m., "month"
- *nox, noctis*, f., "night"
- *lux, lucis*, f., "light" (as in daylight)
- *hora, -ae*, f., "hour"

In each of the time expressions below, note that in translation, we have to insert prepositions to make the translation make sense. They are not explicitly in the Latin as they were in expressions of place, so we have to identify the specific time expression to translate it correctly.

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of time:

1) **Accusative of extent/length of time** (no preposition) ("for ________"):
* **Quattuor annōs** in illā urbe labōrāvit. ("They worked **for four years** in that city").
* **Quīnque mēnsēs** prō templō vīxērunt. ("They lived in front of the temple **for five months**.").

2) **Ablative of time when** (no preposition) ("in/at/on ________"):
* **Illā nocte** puella ab agrīs cucurrit. ("**On that night**, the girl ran from the fields.")
* Nāvis **primā lūce** ex insulā nāvigāvit. ("The ship sailed away from the island **at first light**.")

3) **Ablative of time within which** (no preposition) ("within/in _______"):
* **Primō annō** regnī Carthāginem vīcit. ("**In the first year** of his reign, he conquered Carthage").
* **Quīnque horīs** ad urbem vēnērunt. ("**Within five hours**, they arrived at the city.")

The **ablative of time within which** species a *range* of time within which something happened, while the **ablative of time when** pinpoints an exact time at which the verb happened. There can be some slippage between the two depending on how you interpret the time expression. For example, in the sentence:

**Illā nocte** puella ab agrīs cucurrit.

used above as an example of an ablative of time when, we might also interpret *illā nocte* as an ablative of time within which, yielding the translation:

"*Within that night*, the girl ran away from the fields."
