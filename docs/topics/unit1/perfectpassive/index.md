## The perfect passive


- a compound formation
- use present tense of *sum*: memorize *est*, *sunt*
- use 4th principal part, adjective. Will look more at adjectives in this chapter, but note:
    - gender, number in a subject form (nominative case)
    - **agreement** among 4th part, *sum* and expressed or implied subject
- memorize endings:

| Gender | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Masculine | -us | -i |
| Feminine | -a | -ae |
| Neuter | -um | -a |
