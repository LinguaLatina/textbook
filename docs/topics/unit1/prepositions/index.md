## Prepositions

In Latin, **prepositions** (like "in", "into", "with", "to", English) are indeclinable words followed by a noun in the *ablative* or *accusative* case (called the **object of the preposition**). This unit consisting of preposition and the object of the preposition is called a **prepositional phrase**.

An example of this is the **ablative of agent**. With a passive verb, you can use the preposition *ā/ab* with a word in the ablative case to indicate who performed the action of the verb. For example:

*puer* ***ā puellā*** *amatus est*. The boy was loved **by the girl**.

The prepositional phrase is *ā puellā*, composed of the preposition *ā* and the ablative object of the preposition *puellā*.

Prepositional phrases add more information about the main action of the sentence by answering questions like where, why, which, and how:

* Puellam **in urbe** vīdit. ("She saw the girl in the city.") (**Where** did she see the girl? In the city.)
* **Ob īgnem** fugiēbat. ("He was fleeing because of the fire.") (**Why** was he fleeing? Because of the fire.)
* Hercules monstra **sub ponte** necāvit. ("Hercules killed the monsters under the bridge.) (**Which** monsters did Hercules kill? The ones under the bridge. OR **Where** did Hercules kill the monsters? Under the bridge.)
