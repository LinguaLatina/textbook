## Nouns in the nominative and genitive

Creating noun forms is similar to creating finite verb forms: (1) you find the stem from the dictionary entry, and (2) add the proper ending. For finite verbs, you had to choose the appropriate principal part of the verb to find its stem. For nouns, you use the genitive singular form (the second word in a dictionary entry), and drop the genitive ending. 


> ### TBA: add tables of ending, and worked examples from vocab list
