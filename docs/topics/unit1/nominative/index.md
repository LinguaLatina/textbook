## The nominative case


The **nominative case** is a naming case. Its most frequent function is to indicate the **subject** of a finite verb. 

The subject of a verb will match the person and number of the verb form:  a *singular* noun in the nominative case will have a third person *singular* verb form, and a nominative *plural* noun acting as the subject will match a third person *plural* verb.  We use the term  **agreement** to refer to this matching of grammatical properties.

Consider these examples.  In his account of Theseus' adventures, Hyginus says that Theseus came to Crete:

    Theseus uenit

The dictionary form for Theseus' name in Latin is "*Theseus, Thesei*, m," so *Theseus* is nominative, singular, and masculine.  *uenit*, "he came," is perfect, active and indicative; since it is in the third person singular, it *agrees* with the subject Theseus.

In the story of the seven heroes who fought against Thebes, Hyginus says, "The seven leaders were going there" (in order to fight),

    Septem ductores ibant


*ductor, ductōris*, m., means "leader, commander.  The form *ductores* is masculine, nominative and plural. (We'll see the plural forms of the nominative case below.) *ibant* is in from the irregular verb *eō*, "to go." It is imperfect indicative active.  Even in the irregular form, you can recognize that the ending is third person plural, so it agrees with the plural subject *ductores*.
