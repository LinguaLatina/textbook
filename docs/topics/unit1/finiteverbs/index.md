## Finite verbs


Finite verb forms have five properties: **person**, **number**, **tense**, **mood**, and **voice**. To properly identify a finite verb form, you must identify all five properties. Latin finite verb forms contain all of this information in the verb form itself. In English, we often need other words to convey some of this information, such as subject pronouns to convey the person and number, and auxiliary (or "helping") verbs to express tense, mood, and voice.

### Person

A verb's person expresses the subject of the verb in relation to the "speaker" of the sentence. 

1. The first person (*I* or *we* in English) subject includes the speaker. 
2. The second person (*you* in English) subject is the addressee(s) of the speaker. 
3. The third person (*he, she, it, they* in English) subject is a person or thing separate from the speaker and addressee.  


### Number

Number combines with person in describing the subject of verb. It indicates when the subject is **singular** or **plural**. In English, for example, the first person singular is *I* while first person plural is *we*.



### Tense

The **tense** of a finite verb describes the time of the action.  Latin has six tenses: three of them refer to present or future time, name the **present**, **future**, and **future perfect** tenses.  Three other tenses refer to past time:  the **imperfect**, **perfect** and **pluperfect** tenses. 


### Mood

The mood of a verb indicates the function of the expression and the nature of the action in the speaker's conception. "Mood" and "mode" come from the same root in English: the "mood" of a verb is the "mode" in which the verb is operating.

Latin has moods: 

1. the **indicative**, used to express a statement or question of a factual nature (in the eyes of the speaker) in the past, present, or future.
2. the **imperative**, used to give a command
3. the **subjunctive** mood has many uses in subordinate clauses, and is also used to express potential or possible action. 
 


### Voice

Voice expresses the relationship between the action of the verb and the subject. Like English, Latin has two voices: **active**, in which the subject is performing the action of the verb ("I love"), and **passive**, in which the subject is receiving the action of the verb ("I am loved").
