# Richer sentences 

In Unit 1, we learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences. In Unit 2, we will continue to practice these skills in the context of more complicated syntax, with a particular focus on the different ways that Latin expresses time and place.

We will begin by learning about prepositional phrases and how they can add meaning to Latin verbal expressions. We will build directly on this by looking how Latin uses these and other constructions to express place and time

We will then move on to look at how we can convey different time relations through verbal tense. We will learn about the present and the future tense. After learning these tenses, we will have gained experience working with all four principal parts of a Latin verb!

## Unit Objectives
 
By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Identify expressions of time using the accusative and ablative case
- Identify all persons of the present, future, imperfect, and perfect indicative in both active and passive voices
- Use principal parts to form present, future, imperfect and perfect forms of verbs
- Read more complex Latin sentences
