# Subordination


In Units 1 and 2, we learned how verbs and nouns conjugate and decline to create meaning and structure in Latin sentences, as well as how to express ideas like time and place using prepositional phrases. In Unit 3, we will build on this foundation and begin to read more complex sentences.

We will begin this unit with a consideration of subordination in Latin. We will learn about dependent clauses, focusing in particular on temporal clauses. In our discussion of dependent clauses, we will meet the subjunctive mood for the first time and learn how to form its imperfect and pluperfect tense. In doing so, we will begin to discuss what the subjunctive mood signifies in Latin, a conversation that we will continue for much of the next two semesters.

We will then move on to consider the place of the infinitive in Latin syntax. We will learn the present and perfect forms of the infinitive and discuss three usages of the infinitive: 1) as the subject of a Latin sentence; 2) as a word that complete the meaning of certain verbs; 3) as the main verb in an indirect statement (paraphrases but not quotations of what someone else has said).

## Unit Objectives

- Explain the difference between a dependent and independent clauses
