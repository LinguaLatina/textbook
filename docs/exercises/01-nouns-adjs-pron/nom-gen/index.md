# Nominative and genitive forms


Translate the following phrases or sentences into English. Consult your [vocabulary](#) for words with which you are unfamiliar and your [noun declension charts](../../reference/nouns-paradigms/), [pronoun declension charts](../../reference/pronouns-paradigms/) and [adjective declension charts](../../reference/adjectives-paradigms/) for this module if needed.

Make sure you are translating the correct **case** and **number** for each word. Also, make sure that you are translating adjectives with the words that they modify! (How can you tell? What aspects does an adjective have to match its noun in?)
