# Present Active Participle

The **present active participle** is often translated as the "-ing" form of the verb; for example, "singing", "laughing", "praising", "hearing."

This is easy to confuse, however, with the **gerund**, a verbal *noun* that also ends in -ing. It is important to keep in mind the difference between a participle and a gerund: the participle is a verbal *adjective* that usually modifies a noun, and the gerund is itself a verbal *noun*. If you need to determine whether an -ing form in English is a participle or a gerund, try to add the words "the act of" before the -ing form. If the sentence still makes sense, the -ing form is a gerund; if not, it's a participle. For example:

- We cheered him up by **singing**.
  - We cheered him up by *the act of* **singing**. = gerund

- The **singing** girl was very loud.
  - The *the act of* **singing** girl was very loud. = participle

It is easy to tell the two apart in Latin, however, because they are formed differently. In order to form the **present active participle**, we use the **second principal part**.
  - If a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd conj. verb, chop off the -re, and then add the endings **-ns, -ntis** to form a [**one-termination** adjective](../../../reference/adjectives-paradigms#one-termination-adjectives).
  - If a 3rd -iō or 4th conj. verb, chop off the -re, change the vowel to **-ie-**, and then add your **-ns, -ntis**.

For example:

- laudāre > laudāns, laudantis, "praising"
- monēre > monēns, monentis, "warning"
- regere > regēns, regentis, "ruling"
- capere > capiēns, capientis, "seizing"
- audīre > audiēns, audientis, "listening, hearing"

In all conjugations, the vowel before the **-ns** of the nominative singular will always be long; the vowel before the **-nt-** of the oblique cases will always be short.

So, take a look at some examples of the present active participle in context.

- *puella, carmina multa canēns, cēnam parāvit.* (cēna, -ae, f. - dinner) The girl, singing many songs, prepared dinner.
- *milēs ā duce urbem regente\* interfectus est.* The soldier was killed by the leader ruling the city.

\* Note that the **ablative singular of the present active participle** can end **either in -ī** (the usual ending for one-termination adjectives) **or in -e**. -ī is the ending when the participle is used as a simple adjective (e.g., *ab regentī rege*, "by the ruling king"). -e is used when the participle takes a prepositional phrase or object, as above (*urbem regente*), or is used in an [ablative absolute](#ablative-absolute) (on which see below).

Note that **there is no present passive participle.**

Note also that the literal "-ing" translation of a present active participle can sound stilted and awkward. There are better and preferable ways to translate a participle; see the section on [translating participles](../tense-and-translation/#relative-tense-and-translating-participles/) within this module.

## Present Active Participle of Deponents

We form the present active participle of a **deponent verb** similarly.
- If a 1st or 2nd conj. verb, follow the appropriate rules from above (swapping in -rī for -re in the instructions).
- If a 3rd conj. verb, replace the final -ī of the infinitive with -e- before adding -ns, -ntis.
- If a 3rd -iō conj. verb, replace the final -ī of the infinitive with -ie- before adding the -ns, -ntis.
- If a 4th conj. verb, replace the -īrī of the infinitive with -ie- before adding the -ns, -ntis.

Note that this is one of three exceptions to the rule that deponents are **passive in form but active in meaning**. In this case, the present active participle of a deponent verb is **both active in form AND active in meaning**. We'll learn about the other two exceptions below.

- hortārī > hortāns, hortantis, "exhorting"
- verērī > verēns, verentis, "fearing"
- loquī > loquēns, loquentis, "speaking, saying"
- morī > moriēns, morientis, "dying"
- orīrī ("to rise") > oriēns, orientis, "rising"

Here are some examples of the present active participle of deponents in action:

- *dux, mīlitēs hortāns, profectus est.* The leader, exhorting the soldiers, set out.
- *mīlitem morientem ferēbāmus.* We were carrying the dying soldier.
