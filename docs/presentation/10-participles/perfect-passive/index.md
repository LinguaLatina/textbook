# Perfect Passive Participle

The **perfect passive participle**, or PPP for short, is already familiar to you from the dictionary entries of verbs: the PPP is the **4th principal part** and it functions as a 2-1-2 adjective.

When translated literally, the PPP means **"(having been) [verb]ed."** For example, **amatus puer** = "the boy, having been loved" or "the loved boy." This, however, sounds like stilted translation-ese rather than actual English, so there are a number of ways to make the translation of the PPP -- and participles in general -- more idiomatic in English. See the section within this module on [translating participles](../tense-and-translation/#relative-tense-and-translating-participles/).

Check out these examples of the PPP in context. Remember that as a *verbal adjective*, the participle can govern appropriate constructions. In this case, with a perfect *passive* participle, we can use elements like ablatives of agent to indicate who performed the action of the passive participle.

- *urbs, ā rege horribilī recta, cum mortuus est laeta fuit.* - The city, having been ruled by the horrible king, was happy when he died.
- *frātrēs ā patre eōrum missōs vīdimus.* - We saw the brothers, having been sent by their father.

Note that **there is no perfect active participle**, BUT there is a special consideration with deponent verbs. The PPP of a **deponent verb** (found in its third principal part), like other forms of the deponent verb, is **passive in form but active in meaning**. So, we translate the PPP of a deponent verb as **"having (blank)ed"**. For example:

- *puer, verba illa locutus, discessit.* - The boy, having spoken those words, departed.
