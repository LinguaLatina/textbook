# Irregular Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

There are a number of adjective classes that form their comparative and superlative degrees irregularly.

***

## Superlatives for -er and -lis Adjectives

If the masculine nominative singular positive form of an adjective ends in -er (e.g., **pulcher**, pulchra, pulchrum; **acer**, acris, acre) or in -lis (e.g., **facilis**, -e, "easy"; **similis**, -e, "similar"), the superlative is not formed regularly.

For -er adjectives, you must take the entire masculine nominative singular positive form, duplicate the final consonant, and then add the endings **-imus, -ima, -imum**. For example:

- pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum, "beautiful, handsome" > pulchrior, pulchrius, "more beautiful, more handsome" > pulcher + r + imus = **pulcherrimus, -a, -um**, "most beautiful, most handsome"
- acer, acris, acre, "sharp" > acrior, acrius, "more sharp" > acer + r + imus = **acerrimus, -a, -um**, "most sharp"

**pulcherrimum virum in urbe vīdimus.** We saw the most handsome man in the city.  
**petitī sunt ab acerrimīs mīlitibus.** They were attacked by the fiercest soldiers.  

For -lis adjectives, you must take the *stem* of the adjective, duplicate the final -l, and then add **-imus, -ima, -imum**. For example:

- facilis, -e, "easy" > facilior, facilius, "easier" > facil + l + imus = **facillimus, -a, -um**, "easiest"
- similis, -e, "similar" > similior, similius, "more similar" > simil + l + imus = **simillimus, -a, -um**, "most similar"

**puerī facillima carmina canēbant.** The boys were singing the easiest songs.  
**amīcus meus simillimus mihi est.** My friend is very similar to me.

## Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

Some adjectives have completely irregular changes from the positive to the comparative to the superlative degree and simply must be memorized. Here is a chart of irregular comparatives and superlatives and some notes on specific forms.

| Positive      | Comparative | Superlative |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| bonus, -a, -um, "good"    | melior, melius, "better"       | optimus, -a, -um, "best"       |
| magnus, -a, -um, "big"   | maior, maius, "bigger"        | maximus, -a, -um, "biggest"  |
| malus, -a, -um, "bad"   | pēior, pēius, "worse"     | pessimus, -a, -um, "worst" |
| multus, -a, -um, "much; many"   | \*plūs, plūris, "more"       | plūrimus, -a, -um, "most"  |
| parvus, -a, -um, "small"   | minor, minus, "smaller"        | minimus, -a, -um, "smallest, least"  |
| \*\*(none) | prior, prius, "former, previous" | prīmus, -a, -um, "first" |
| superus, -a, -um, "upper"   | superior, superius, "higher"        | summus, -a, -um, "highest, furthest; top of"; suprēmus, -a, -um, "highest, last"  |

\* **plūs, plūris** is an odd form that acts like a **third declension neuter noun in the singular** but an **irregular third declension adjective in the plural**.

**Singular**

| Case      | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | plūs       |
| Genitive   | plūris  |
| Dative   | (no dative form)  |
| Accusative   | plūs  |
| Ablative   | plūre  |

Because the singular acts as a noun, it cannot modify another noun. As a result, this noun often takes a construction called the **partitive genitive**, a genitive noun that indicates what there is more of. For example:
- **plūs pecūniae habēmus.** We have more money. (literally, "We have more of money.")

**Plural**

| Case      | M./F. | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | plūrēs       | **plūra**       |
| Genitive   | plūrium        | plūrium  |
| Dative   | plūribus       | plūribus  |
| Accusative   | plūrēs        | **plūra**  |
| Ablative   | plūribus        | plūribus  |

Note that the plural forms are adjectives that must agree with a noun in gender, case, and number (e.g., **plūrēs mīlitēs**, "more soldiers"; **plūrium carminum**, "of more songs"), but the neuter nominative and accusative plural do not have the expected -ia ending; instead, the ending is simply **-a**.

\*\* **prior** and **prīmus** do not have a positive degree, since their very definitions ("previous" and "first" respectively) necessarily are comparative and superlative in nature; something cannot be "previous" without being "previous" to something else.
