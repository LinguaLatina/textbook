# Adverb Degrees - Overview

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. We've seen many examples of adverbs throughout this course, including ones like *nōn* and *tamen*. Such adverbs are indeclinable and have only positive degrees.

Other types of adverbs can be formed from adjectives in English by adding -ly to an adjective, indicating that a verbal action is being completed in an [adjective] manner. For example:

- He walked *quickly.* (i.e., in a quick manner)
- They sang *beautifully.* (i.e., in a beautiful manner)

Such adverbs, like adjectives, have a degree: positive, comparative, or superlative. The same relationships apply: positive is the base degree of an adverb, comparative corresponds to "more", and superlative corresponds to "most." For example:

- He sang **beautifully**. (positive)
- She sang **more beautifully**. (comparative)
- But they sang **most beautifully**. (superlative)

For these adverbs, we can use the adjectives from which they are derived to create adverbs in each of the three degrees.

## Positive Adverbs

To form the positive degree of an adverb from an adjective:
- if a 2-1-2, add **-ē** to the stem:
  - pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum, "beautiful" > **pulchrē**, "beautifully"
  - laetus, -a, -um, "happy" > **laetē**, "happily"
- if a third declension adjective, add **-iter** to the stem, unless the stem ends in **-nt-**, in which case add only **-er**:
  - ferox, ferocis, "fierce" > **ferociter**, "fiercely"
  - acer, acris, acre, "sharp" > **acriter**, "sharply"
  - sapiēns, sapientis, "wise" > **sapienter**, "wisely"

**magister discipulōs sapienter docuit.** The teacher taught the students wisely.  
**familia laetē cēnam parāvit.** The family happily prepared dinner.  

Note also that the **neuter nom./acc. sg.** form of an adjective can often be used as an adverb:
- **is illa carmina** ***facile*** **didicit**. He learned those songs **easily**.
- **tē multum amō**. I love you **much**.

## Comparative Adverbs

The comparative degree of an adjective-derived adverb almost always exactly corresponds to the neuter nom./acc. sg. comparative form of the adjective:
- **pulchrius**, "more beautifully"
- **laetius**, "more happily"
- **ferocius**, "more fiercely"
- **acrius**, "more sharply"
- **sapientius**, "more wisely"

**mīlitēs nostrī ferocius quam illī pugnāvērunt**. Our soldiers fought more fiercely than those (soldiers).  
**ea carmina pulchrius quam is canit.** She is singing the songs more beautifully than he (is).

## Superlative Adverbs

The superlative degree of an adjective-derived adverb is formed by adding **-ē** to the superlative adjective stem:
- **pulcherrimē**, "most beautifully"
- **laetissimē**, "most happily"
- **ferocissimē**, "most fiercely"
- **acerrimē**, "most sharply"
- **sapientissimē**, "most wisely"

**sapientissimē dīxit.** He spoke very wisely.  
**virī ferocissimē clamāvērunt.** The men shouted most fiercely.  

Note that comparative and superlative adverbs can also be used with **quam** to indicate "than" or "as [adverb] as possible" respectively, similar to its use with comparative and superlative adjectives. The ablative of comparison is not usually used with comparative adverbs.
