# Fear Clauses

If the subject of an independent is/was fearful that some type of verbal action is/was going to occur, in Latin the action that they are afraid of is expressed as a dependent clause. The dependent clause is usually referred to as a **fear clause**.

A fear clause always depends on a main clause that contains a **verb of fearing** (e.g., *timeō*, *vereor*, *metuō*, *terreor*) and is introduced either by **ne** for a **positive** fear clause and **ut** for a **negative** fear clause. Note that this is the opposite of what we might expect based on purpose or result clauses: **nē** indicates that it is feared that the fear clause WILL happen, while **ut** indicates that it is feared that the fear clause WILL NOT happen.

Fear clauses always feature a subjunctive verb in the present or imperfect tense, depending on the [**sequence of tenses**](../08-temporal-clauses/#subjunctive-verbs-and-the-sequence-of-tenses/).

When translating a fear clause, we translate **nē** as "that" or **ut** as "that...not". If the verb in the clause is in the present subjunctive, we translate it as "*would verb*." If the verb is in the imperfect subjunctive, we render it as "*verbed*." Below are some examples:

- *Hostēs metuunt ne dux captus fugiat.* ("The enemies fear that the leader who was captured would escape.")
- *Timuit ut uxor amaret.* ("He was afraid that his wife did not love him.")
