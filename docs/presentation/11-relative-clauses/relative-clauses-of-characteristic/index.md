# Relative Clauses of Characteristic

Most of the relative clauses that we've seen use indicative verbs because the clause is describing a **definite, factual** antecedent. However, we can also use a **subjunctive verb** in the relative clause when the antecedent is **general, indefinite, interrogative, or negative**. This use of a relative clause with a subjunctive verb is called a **relative clause of characteristic**, because it defines a quality or characteristic of an antecedent that itself is general, indefinite, etc.

In translation, we can sometimes use the auxiliary verb "would" to render the subjunctive, and the antecedent can sometimes be prefaced by "the sort of" or "the kind of". We also often have to supply words in our translation based on, e.g., the gender and number of pronouns or nouns to help the translation make sense.

Take a look at the following examples:

- **quis est cui credāmus?** Who is there whom we would trust?
- **eī nōn sunt quī hoc faciant.** They are not the kind of people who would do this.
- **is erat quī veritātem dīceret**. He was the sort of guy who would speak the truth. (veritās, veritātis, f. - truth)
- **nēmō est quī hostem petere possit**. There is no one who can attack the enemy. (nēmō, neminis - nobody, no one)
