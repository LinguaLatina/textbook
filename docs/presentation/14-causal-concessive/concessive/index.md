# Concessive Clauses

**Concessive clauses** are dependent clauses that indicate that the action of the main clause happens *despite* circumstances in the dependent clause that appear to hinder it. There are a number of words that can introduce concessive clauses (*quamvis*, *licet*, *quamquam*, *cum*), which usually are translated as "although", "even though", or "though." Additionally, there are certain adverbs that can appear in the main clause, such as **tamen** ("nevertheless"), that indicate that the main clause's action is at odds with the circumstances of the dependent clause. These clauses can take either the indicative or the subjunctive, depending on the conjunction used.

**Quamquam** always takes the indicative and introduces an admitted fact.

- *Quamquam senex nōn fortis erat, tamen magnā sapientiā regnāvit.* (Although the old man was not strong, he nevertheless ruled with great wisdom.)

**Quamvis** (literally, "as much as you wish") always takes the subjunctive.

- *Quamvis lingua Latina difficilis esset, tamen eam facile didicit.* (Although the Latin language was difficult, she nevertheless learned it easily.)

**Licet** (literally, "it is allowed/granted") is a conjunction that is used with the present or perfect subjunctive only. This is because of a weird shift from a verb in primary sequence towards the conjunction that can introduce a concessive clause.

- *Licet omnēs horribilēs mē petiverint, Roma valet.* (Although all the horrible people attacked me, Rome remains strong.)

**Cum clauses** that feature a subjunctive verb can indicate concession. In these cases, we translate *cum* as "although", "even though", or "though", as we would with *quamquam*, *quamvis*, or *licet*.

- *Cum puerum amaret, tamen ex urbe abiit.* (Although he loved the girl, he nevertheless left the city.)

Note in the sentence above, it would not make any sense if you translate it anything other than "although." *cum* at this point can indicate concession, cause, or time, so you have to use the context of the sentence to figure out which is the best translation. You must ask what question the *cum* clause is answering with relation to the main clause:
- does it express *when* the main verb happened? (temporal, "when", "after", "while")
- does it express *why* or *for what reason* the main verb happened? (causal, "because")
- does it express *what obstacles* might get in the way of completing the action of the main verb? (concessive, "although")

More to the point, the main clause in the sentence above contains a dead giveaway for a concessive clause: the adverb *tamen*, "nevertheless." Because of that adverb, other translations don't make as much sense: "when he loved the girl, he nevertheless left the city" or "because he loved the girl, he nevertheless left the city." The action of loving is an obstacle to leaving the city, so a concessive translation makes the most sense.

Once again, if there is a concessive clause in indirect statement, the concessive clause will always have a subjunctive verb.
