# The Pluperfect Tense

## Conceptual Overview

The **pluperfect tense** indicates an action that occurred *prior* to an action in the past. So, we usually translate the pluperfect with the auxiliary verb **"had"**.

- *frātrēs vīdī. eī ex urbe* ***vēnerant***. I saw the brothers. They **had come** out of the city.
- *mea uxor laeta erat. carmen eī* ***cecineram***. My wife was happy. I **had sung** a song for her.

Note the difference between the translation of the **perfect** and the translation of the **pluperfect**. The perfect tense uses "has" or "have"; the pluperfect tense uses "had". This difference in translation indicates two different time periods, so it's important to be accurate!

## Pluperfect Active

To form the **pluperfect active indicative**, we begin by taking the perfect stem (the third principal part minus the final -ī) and add the pluperfect active endings. They look *exactly* like the imperfect forms of *sum*, *esse*:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -eram       | -erāmus      |
| 2nd  | -erās        | -erātis       |
| 3rd  | **-erat**        | **-erant**     |

So, if we wanted to form the 3rd person singular pluperfect active indicative of *videō*:

*vīdī* -> *vīd-* (perfect active stem) -> (add personal ending) *vīderat*, "he/she/it had seen"

## Pluperfect Passive

We form the **pluperfect passive indicative** in a manner very similar to that of the perfect passive indicative. We use the 4th principal part as a 2-1-2 adjective that matches the subject in gender, case, and number, and then we conjugate a form of *sum*, *esse* in the appropriate person and number; in this case, with the pluperfect passive, we will use the **imperfect** forms of *sum*.

For instance, for the verb *videō*:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | vīsus/vīsa/vīsum eram       |  vīsī/vīsae/vīsa erāmus    |
| 2nd  | vīsus/vīsa/vīsum erās       | vīsī/vīsae/vīsa erātis       |
| 3rd  | **vīsus/vīsa/vīsum erat**        | **vīsī/vīsae/vīsa erant**     |

# The Future Perfect Tense

## Conceptual Overview

The **future perfect tense** indicates an action that occurs in the future but *before* an action further in the future. Take a look at this example in English:

- We **will have arrived** before you will wake up. (*The action of our arriving occurs BEFORE the action of your waking up.*)

So, we usually translate the pluperfect with the auxiliary verbs **"will have"**. The "will" part conveys the future part of the tense; the "have" part conveys the perfect part of the tense.

## Future Perfect Active

To form the **future perfect active indicative**, we begin by taking the perfect stem (the third principal part minus the final -ī) and add the future perfect active endings. They look almost exactly like the future forms of *sum*, *esse* EXCEPT for the 3rd plural:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -erō       | -erimus      |
| 2nd  | -eris        | -eritis       |
| 3rd  | **-erit**        | **-erint**     |

So, if we wanted to form the 3rd person plural future perfect active indicative of *regō*:

*rexī* -> *rex-* (perfect active stem) -> (add personal ending) *rexerint*, "they will have ruled"  

## Future Perfect Passive

We form the **future perfect passive indicative** in a manner very similar to that of the perfect passive indicative. We use the 4th principal part as a 2-1-2 adjective that matches the subject in gender, case, and number, and then we conjugate a form of *sum*, *esse* in the appropriate person and number; in this case, with the future perfect passive, we will use the **future** forms of *sum*. (Note that we use the normal 3rd pl. form, *erunt*, rather than the -i- present in the future perfect active ending.)

For instance, for the verb *moneō*:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | monitus/monita/monitum erō       |  monitī/monitae/monita erimus    |
| 2nd  | monitus/monita/monitum eris       | monitī/monitae/monita eritis       |
| 3rd  | **monitus/monita/monitum erit**        | **monitī/monitae/monita erunt**     |
