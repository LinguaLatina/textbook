# The Present Tense

## Conceptual Overview

The **present tense** indicates that the action of a verb is happening at the same time as the speaker's utterance. For example, in the sentence "I write about the present tense", the verb "write" indicates that the process of writing is currently happening. The present tense can also show an action in progress through the use of a form of the verb "to be" and the addition of -ing to the verb; for example, "we are learning about Latin." The verb "are learning" indicates that learning is in the process of happening!

Here are some more English examples of the present tense, with the Latin equivalent of the verb in parentheses:

* She is coming (*venit*) from the market.
* An exam is being given (*datur*) by the teacher.
* He writes (*scrībit*) a letter.
* We are looking for (*petimus*) our friends.

So, the present can be translated in various ways: in the third person singular active voice, as a simple present like "he gives", a present progressive like "he is giving", or an emphatic present like "he does give"; in the third person singular passive voice, "he is (being) given."

## All Conjugations

This is a broad overview of the formation of the present tense across all conjugations. If you prefer a more structured and compartmentalized approach to the differences between the conjugations, see the sections below on the [1st and 2nd conjugations](#1st-and-2nd-conjugations) and [3rd, 4th, and 3rd -iō conjugations](#3rd-4th-and-3rd--io-conjugations).

This chart overviews the present tense in the active and passive voice across all conjugations. Note the patterns, both within individual conjugations and across conjugations: for example, what vowels precede the personal endings of *-ō, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt* or *-r, -ris, -tur, -mur, -minī, -ntur* in a given conjugation? Focus for now, though, on the bolded 3rd person forms.

**Active**

|     | 1st  | 2nd  | 3rd  | 3rd -iō  | 4th  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st sg. | amō | moneō | regō | cupiō | audiō |
| 2nd sg. | amās | monēs | regis | cupis | audīs |
| 3rd sg. | **amat** | **monet** | **regit** | **cupit** | **audit** |
| 1st pl. | amāmus | monēmus | regimus | cupimus | audīmus |
| 2nd pl. | amātis | monētis | regitis | cupitis | audītis |
| 3rd pl. | **amant** | **monent** | **regunt** | **cupiunt** | **audiunt** |

**Passive**

|      | 1st  | 2nd  | 3rd  | 3rd -iō  | 4th  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st sg. | amor | moneor | regor | cupior | audior |
| 2nd sg. | amāris | monēris | regiris | cuperis | audīris |
| 3rd sg. | **amātur** | **monētur** | **regitur** | **cupitur** | **audītur** |
| 1st pl. | amāmur | monēmur | regimur | cupimur | audīmur |
| 2nd pl. | amāminī| monēminī| regiminī| cupiminī| audīminī|
| 3rd pl. | **amantur** | **monentur** | **reguntur** | **cupiuntur** | **audiuntur** |

## 1st and 2nd Conjugations

This is a specific overview of the formation of the present tense in the 1st and 2nd conjugations. For a broader overview of the present tense across all conjugations, see the section above on the [present tense across all conjugations](#all-conjugations).

If you need the first person singular present active indicative form of the verb, you automatically have it from the **first principal part** of the dictionary entry. For example, with the verb *amō*, *amāre*, *amāvī*, *amātus*, "to love", the first principal part, *amō*, is your first person present active indicative form, which means "I love."

To form the present indicative in the other persons and numbers in the **1st and 2nd conjugation**, we begin by finding the verb's present stem. To find it, you go to the **second principal part** of the verb's dictionary entry and then chop off the final *-re*. For example, with the same example verb, we would go to the second principal part, *amāre*, and chop off the final *-re*, which leaves us with the present stem: *amā-*. The second conjugation works the same way: for example, with the verb *moneō*, *monēre*, *monuī*, *monitus*, "to warn, advise", the present stem would be *monē-*.

From there, you add your personal endings, which are shown below (focus on the **bolded** third person forms for the first part of this semester):

**Active**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | (-ō)       | -mus      |
| 2nd  | -s        | -tis       |
| 3rd  | **-t**        | **-nt**     |

So, for example, the 3rd person plural present active indicative form of *amō* is *amant*, "they love." The 2nd person singular present active indicative form of *moneō* is *monēs*, "you warn."

For the **passive** forms, you would tack on the **passive** personal endings onto your present stem (for the 1st person singular, you would tack the ending directly onto the active form):

**Passive**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -r       | -mur      |
| 2nd  | -ris        | -minī       |
| 3rd  | **-tur**        | **-ntur**     |

So, for example, the 1st person singular present passive indicative of *amō* is *amor*, "I am (being) loved." The third person singular present passive indicative of *moneō* is *monētur*, "he/she/it is (being) warned."

## 3rd, 4th, and 3rd -iō Conjugations

This is a specific overview of the formation of the present tense in the 3rd, 4th, and 3rd -iō conjugations. For a broader overview of the present tense across all conjugations, see the section above on the [present tense across all conjugations](#all-conjugations).

In the 3rd, 4th, and 3rd -iō conjugations in the present indicative, there are a number of vowel changes at the end of the present stem from person to person and number to number before we apply the active and passive endings listed in the charts above. You must be aware of these vowel shifts to conjugate a verb correctly.

### 3rd Conjugation

Let's conjugate the third conjugation verb *regō*, *regere*, *rēxī*, *rectus*, "to rule", in the **present active indicative** as an example. As above, we can get the 1st person singular form from the first principal part of the verb: *regō*, "I rule." For the remaining forms, if we follow the procedure from above, we go to *regere* and chop off the *-re*, and then we have the present stem *rege-*. The *-e* at the end of the present stem becomes an *-i* in all forms except the **3rd pl**, in which it becomes a *-u*. Then we add our personal endings (*-s*, *-t*, *-mus*, *-tis*, *-nt*).

So, the **present active indicative** of *regō* looks like this (focus on the **bolded** 3rd person forms):

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | regō       | regimus      |
| 2nd  | regis       | regitis       |
| 3rd  | **regit**        | **regunt**     |

The **present passive indicative** of the third conjugation swaps out the active personal endings for passive ones (*-r*, *-ris*, *-tur*, *-mur*, *-minī*, *-ntur*). The vowel shifts are identical to those in the active with one exception: the **2nd sg.** retains the *-e*, rather than changing to an *-i*. Take a look at this chart (and again, focus on the bolded forms):

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | regor       | regimur      |
| 2nd  | regeris        | regiminī       |
| 3rd  | **regitur**        | **reguntur**     |

### 4th Conjugation

The **fourth conjugation** follows the pattern of **1st** and **2nd conjugation verbs** (go to the infinitive, chop off the *-re*, add your endings) with one crucial exception: the **3rd pl.** form shifts the vowel at the end of the stem from *-i* to *-iu*. So, let's take the sample verb *audiō*, *audīre*, *audīvī*, *audītus*, "to hear." The present stem is *audī-*.

**Active**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | audiō       | audīmus      |
| 2nd  | audīs      | audītis       |
| 3rd  | **audit**        | **audiunt**     |

**Passive**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | audior       | audīmur      |
| 2nd  | audīris      | audīminī       |
| 3rd  | **audītur**        | **audiuntur**     |

### 3rd -iō Conjugation

The **third -iō conjugation** is a mixture of 3rd and 4th conjugation forms; such verbs as *capiō*, *capere*, *cēpī*, *captus*, "to seize, capture", follow 3rd conjugation patterns in most forms but 4th conjugation patterns in the **3rd pl.**

**Active**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | capiō       | capimus      |
| 2nd  | capis      | capitis       |
| 3rd  | **capit**        | **capiunt**     |

**Passive**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | capior       | capimur      |
| 2nd  | caperis      | capiminī       |
| 3rd  | **capitur**        | **capiuntur**     |

Note that often, one letter can make the difference, so it is imperative that you recognize what conjugation a verb belongs to in order to conjugate it correctly!
