# ADD SECTION ON DEMONSTRATIVE AND INTENSIVE PRONOUNS? SEE IRREGULAR SECTION IN [ADJECTIVES](adjectives)

## Pronouns - *is, ea, id*

Sometimes, Latin uses pronouns to stand in for nouns. The most common Latin pronoun is *is, ea, id* ("he", "she", "it"). The dictionary entry for *is, ea, id* represents the nominative singular forms for all three genders (once again, masculine, feminine, and neuter from left to right).

The declension chart for *is*, *ea*, *id* can be found [here](../../charts/1-nouns#pronouns).

The noun to which a pronoun refers is called the pronoun's **antecedent**. The pronoun used in place of the noun must have the same **gender** and **number** as the antecedent. For instance, you would use *ea* to substitute for *mater* and *is* to substitute for *pater*. This also applies for nouns that are not typically biologically gendered. For the Latin word for table (*mensa*), you would use *ea* as the pronoun because the noun is feminine.

The declension for the pronoun is tricky, so be sure to consult the paradigm chart linked above so you are able to recognize its forms.

### Practice Opportunity

Substitute each of the following words with a form of *is*, *ea*, *id* that matches it in **gender**, **case**, and **number**. Each word is either in the nominative or genitive case. Make sure to consult the [declension chart of *is*, *ea*, *id*](../../charts/1-nouns#pronouns), the [general noun declension charts](../../charts/1-nouns), and your [Module 1 vocabulary](../../vocab/1) for help.
